# Downloads Folder Cleanup Tool - BETA

I am currently testing this tool just to automate removal of specific file types in my downloads folder.
Please use at your own risk.

## How to run

Requirements (to start):
Python 3, although this is written in 3.10.2

To install python, you can download it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

You can first navigate to the folder directory, via the command line. In windows this can be accessed by:
Windows button (and search) cmd.

You're looking for the "Command Prompt"

You can download this git repo via git if you have it installed by running this command.

```git clone https://github.com/c01952f666540050efb7f2750d8e3e91/cleardl.git```

You can download git via:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then you can install the required packages.

```cd clear-dl```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You can then run the script via:

```python3 -m clear-dl.py```

If you do not have python scripts in your PATH folder. (I can show you how to do this if you'd like).

There are some specific arguments:

```python3 -m clear-dl.py --filepath C:\Users\USERID\Downloads```

So you can select the specific path that you want to remove from.
And that's it! You won't need to do much else.

## Current roadmap

To make this universal we will need to add some features
- We will need to add os detection
- It will have to remove the dependency on knowing the appdata folder to store the files temporarily
- Add ability to run this script at the end of day, for example
- we should add encryption and upload as a later feature once everything is working correctly.
