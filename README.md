# Downloads Folder Cleanup Tool - BETA

I am currently testing this tool just to automate removal of specific file types in my downloads folder.
Please use at your own risk.

## Current roadmap

To make this universal we will need to add some features
- We will need to add os detection
- It will have to remove the dependency on knowing the appdata folder to store the files temporarily
- we should add encryption and upload as a later feature once everything is working correctly.
